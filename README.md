# SQL Analytics for Supply Chain Optimization

### Project Overview:
This project focuses on optimizing the supply chain operations for **Atliq Hardware** using advanced SQL queries. By analyzing sales data, forecasted quantities, and customer behaviors, we derived actionable insights to improve inventory management, predict demand, and calculate financial-year-based sales performance.

### Problem Statement:
Atliq Hardware faced challenges in managing its supply chain due to:
- Difficulty in accurately forecasting inventory requirements.
- Complex customer sales analysis across financial years.
- Mismatches between forecasted and sold quantities leading to stockouts or overstocking.

### Solution:
Using SQL analytics, we tackled these challenges by:
- Creating custom SQL queries to merge forecasted and actual sales data.
- Analyzing customer sales trends over multiple financial years.
- Calculating optimized reorder points to prevent stockouts while minimizing overstock.
- Developing a SQL-based reporting structure for continuous monitoring of supply chain metrics.

### Key Features:
- **Financial Year Sales Analysis**: Dynamic customer sales comparison across fiscal years.
- **Supply Chain Efficiency**: Consolidation of forecasted vs. sold quantities for better inventory management.
- **Inventory Optimization**: Calculation of reorder points and prediction of restocking needs based on data trends.

### Learnings:
- Improved proficiency in SQL queries for real-world business problems.
- Gained insights into handling complex supply chain and inventory data.
- Enhanced ability to derive actionable insights from financial year data.
- Strengthened understanding of demand forecasting and supply chain optimization.
